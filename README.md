Darkmodelib is a C++ library that brings modern visual features, such as dark mode, custom color schemes, and Windows 11's Mica material, to applications built with the Win32 API. It provides support for the most common controls and is designed to simplify integration into legacy applications, making it easier to modernize their look and feel without a complete rewrite.
